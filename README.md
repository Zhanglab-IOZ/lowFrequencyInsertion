# lowFrequencyInsertion  
ALU, one of the most successful transposable elements, remains actively mobile in the human genome with a copy number well in excess of 1 million. Detecting ALU insertions, however, proves to be challenging due to the chimera artifacts generated by both PCR and single-cell genome amplification. These artifacts often introduce false positive insertions (Fig1, Fig2).  
lowFrequencyInsertion is a tool specifically designed for the sensitive detection of low-frequency ALU insertions. It rules out chimera artifacts, leveraging the fact that the ALU length (~300 bp) closely mirrors the normal fragment length (~400 bp) of the next-generation sequencing (Fig2).
